**Uber Homepage Remake**
========================

Welcome to my responsive remake of the Uber homepage. The project was developed as a way to demonstrate my understanding of responsive web design and my ability to replicate an existing design.

The remake of the Uber homepage is fully responsive, with a design that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and follows the latest web development standards.

The layout, typography and images are based on the official Uber website, while the functionality of the page is limited and not fully operational, the page serves as a visual replica.

Some of the key features of the responsive redesign include:

- A mobile-first design that looks great on all devices

- A flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes

- A modern, clean look that is easy to navigate

- The use of CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes

Built With HTML, CSS and React
